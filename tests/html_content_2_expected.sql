    To get the permission that you need to query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS view,

    ask your administrator to grant you the


BigQuery Resource Viewer  (roles/bigquery.resourceViewer) IAM role on your project.




For more information about granting roles, see Manage access.



      This predefined role contains the
       bigquery.jobs.listAll permission, which is
        required to query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS view.



  
    You might also be able to get
      this permission
    with custom roles or
    other predefined roles.
  For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
Access control with IAM.
